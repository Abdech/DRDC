                <h3> Dairy Research and Development Center </h3> 
                <p>
                    Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi was established in 1980 as the Federal University of Technology, Bauchi,
                    Bauchi State, Nigeria. In 1984, it was merged with the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria and renamed Abubakar Tafawa
                    Balewa College (ATBC-ABU), but de-merged in 1988 to regain its autonomy as full-fledged University of Technology.
                    <br> <br>
                    
                    The Dairy Research and Development Centre was established in 2015 initiated by the Tertiary Education Trust Fund
                    (Tetfund) with emphasise on research in all aspects of dairying towards reducing poverty and improving food security and
                    nutrition. The main activity at the Centre commenced in 2020. To further drive the Centre, support programmes such as
                    Tetfund Centre of Excellence (TCoE) and Tetfund Mega Dairy Research and Development were introduced in 2020 and 2021
                    respectively.
                    
                    <br> <br>
                    The majority of cattle in the world are found in developing countries located in the tropics and sub-tropics regions.
                    Tropical cattle although well adapted to the various ecological zones which range from deserts to tropical forests, have
                    relatively low potential for high production thereby necessitating improvement in their genetic potential especially for
                    milk production which improves the efficiency of converting inputs into outputs. This can be achieved through
                    crossbreeding, breeding and selection or new breed development.
                    <br> <br>
                    Currently, the Centre has two indigenous breeds of cattle (Wadara and Bunaji), Friesian and their crosses. The lactating
                    cows are yielding an appreciable quantity of milk. The Centre is sitting on about 400 ha of land and half of that is
                    earmarked for pasture development. The feed resource for roughage is from baled hay while concentrate is formulated
                    using feed mill of the Centre.
                    <br> <br>
                    The foregoing will provide improved/upgraded dairy cross bred cattle, milk and milk products, research opportunities,
                    capacity building and support to students, staff and livestock farmers. The proceeds from the Centre that generate
                    revenue for the University include milk and milk products, feedlot, baled hay, cattle dung and tractor hiring.
