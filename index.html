                Dairy, a bountiful gift from nature, reverberates with great significance to humans and animals. Beyond its flavorful
                composition and filling essence, it represents a history of nourishment and serves as a link between age-old customs and
                contemporary wellness. There is a reminder of our symbiotic link with the earth and its inhabitants in every glass of
                milk and milk products. As we appreciate what dairy has to give, it is also significant in health, nutrition, and
                humanity's quest for physical and spiritual nourishment. “One heifer is enough the nation, a cup of milk is enough the
                family”.
